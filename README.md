## üìÖ Development Log

### Day 1
- Set up project folder and `main.cpp`
- Implemented simple login system with password check
- Compiled and tested successfully
- Uploaded initial version to GitHub

### Day 2
- Added main menu with options for:
  - Check balance
  - Deposit
  - Withdraw
- Used reference passing for modifying account balance
- Improved code formatting and fixed typos
- Compiled and tested in Terminal using `g++`

### Day 3
- Introduced transaction history using `vector<string>`
- Logged user actions: check balance, deposit, withdraw
- Used `push_back()` to append transactions
- Passed `vector<string>&` to functions to keep track of history
- Reviewed and practiced C++ reference syntax (`&variable`)
- Tested transaction recording and ensured correct looping behavior

### Day 4
- Added input validation with `getValidOption()` and `getValidAmount()`
- Used `cin.clear()` and `cin.ignore()` to handle invalid user inputs
- Prevented program from crashing on non-numeric input
- Improved user experience with clear error messages
- Enabled C++11 support to suppress compiler warnings

### Day 5
- Refactored user login system to support multiple users
- Defined `User` struct to hold username, password, balance, and transaction history
- Implemented `login()` function returning pointer to the logged-in user
- Modified functions to accept `User*` and operate on the logged-in user‚Äôs data
- Handled login attempts with a maximum of 3 tries and proper error messages
- Cleaned up `main()` to integrate new login logic and per-user transactions

### Day 6
- Implemented file-based user data loading and saving via `users.txt`
- Replaced hardcoded users with file input using `ifstream`
- Parsed each line to extract username, password, and balance using `substr()` and `find()`
- Loaded user data into a `vector<User>` at the start of the program
- Used `ofstream` to write back updated user data at program exit
- Ensured data persistence for balances after deposit/withdraw
- Prepared structure for future transaction file saving
