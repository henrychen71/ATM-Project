# üèß ATM Project (C++)

A simple console-based ATM simulation written in C++.

## ‚úÖ Features (in progress)
- [x] User login with password verification
- [x] View account balance
- [x] Deposit funds
- [x] Withdraw funds
- [x] Transaction history
- [ ] Multi-user support

## üìÖ Development Log

### Day 1
- Set up project folder and main.cpp
- Implemented simple login system with password check
- Compiled and tested successfully
- Uploaded initial version to GitHub

### Day 2
- Added main menu with options for:
  - Check balance
  - Deposit
  - Withdraw
- Used reference passing for modifying account balance
- Improved code formatting and fixed typos
- Compiled and tested in Terminal using `g++`

### Day 3
- Introduced transaction history using `vector<string>`
- Logged user actions: check balance, deposit, withdraw
- Used `push_back()` to append transactions
- Passed `vector<string>&` to functions to keep track of history
- Reviewed and practiced C++ reference syntax (`&variable`)
- Tested transaction recording and ensured correct looping behavior

### Day 4
- Added input validation with `getValidOption()` and `getValidAmount()`
- Used `cin.clear()` and `cin.ignore()` to handle invalid user inputs
- Prevented program from crashing on non-numeric input
- Improved user experience with clear error messages
- Enabled C++11 support to suppress compiler warning for range-based loop

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
- C++
- GCC / G++ for compilation
- Visual Studio Code

## üîß How to Run
```bash
g++ main.cpp -o atm -std=c++11
./atm
